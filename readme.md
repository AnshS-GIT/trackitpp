## Backend Initial Setup 

This phase focuses on setting up a clean and reliable backend starting point for the project.

The goal during this stage was to establish a production-ready base that follows real-world backend practices, making the codebase easy to maintain, extend, and scale as new features are added.

Key work completed in this phase includes:

- Setting up an Express server with environment-based configuration
- Adding centralized error handling for consistent API responses
- Enabling request-level logging using Morgan for better visibility
- Separating application setup from server startup logic
- Creating a scalable folder structure for routes, controllers, and services
